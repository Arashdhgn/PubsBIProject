# Pubs BI Project
we Start with creating a Data Profiling Package for the Tables we want to transfer to DW from OP

how:
1. Drag and drop an Data Profiling task
2. Open the task and give it a Valid destination or create a new destination File
3. Click on Quick Profile and choose your data source (the OP table yuo need the profile for)
4. Execute task and the files will be created
5. to checkout the resualts you can use Open Profile Viewer

* If you want to execute this tasks more than once and get fresh data, set the overwrite destination option to True
* Rember to create a new connection File For each table if you want to see then seperatly'

we can use this profiling data to design our DW.
